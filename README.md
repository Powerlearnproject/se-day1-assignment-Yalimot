Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software  Engineering the a systematic way of applying engineerig mmethods, principles and tools to develop and maintain quality software systems.
Importance of Software Engineering 
a) It enables creation of softwares that are used in health care sector to monitor patients and even recommend medicine.
b) It has enabled e-commerce such that softwarers are able to keep track of customer preferences and recommend to them more items in the said line.
c) Software engineering has enabled development of high quality sooftwares which are easy to use. It lso ensures that the sofwares are maintained to continue offering services and improve them for better performance.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) Development of programming languages  - this are languages used to write codes that eventually become a software to perform specific role. A good example of the programming language is C.
b) Advent of structured programming (1970s) - This are high level programming languages that were understood by human beings because they are written in english like statements and are procedural. 
c) Development of Agile methodologies(2000s)- Are methods that are flexible and involves iterative ways of handling projects. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirements - Establishing user needs and the system requiremnts and it is done through information gathering.
b) Design - A detailed architectural design of a software with user interface
c) implementation- the process of building the software by writing the code according to the design specified.
d) Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality and functional requirements.
e) Deployment - involves releasing of the software to the users. 
f) Maintenance - Process of providing continuous support, updates and enhancemnts to the software after deploying it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology - is a method that has predefined stages that a project must go through without changing them whereas Agile methodology is an  iterative  and flexibl method that involves or allows users to actively participate in project development actively.
In waterfall the product is at the end of the process which is rigid whereas in Agile the product is produced at every stage.
waterfall would be good in scenerio where are the requrements are known and are unlikely to change and Agile would be good with project whose requirements are ever changing.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software developer - this is the person who is responsible in writing the program codes and implement software solutions
b) Quality Assurance Engineer - is the Engineer who is concerned with software quality by developing and executing tests
c) Projet Manager - Oversee the overal project, coordinates activities and allocates the resource to ensure success of the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE - is a comprehensive development platform that provides toolls for code writing, debbuging and testing the softwares developed an example is Visual Studio. 
VSC - Are software tools that are used for tracking changes to the source code and coordinating team work among members e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Ever changing requirements  - This can be solved by carrying out extensive research to refine the requirements and define properly the project scope. They can also use Agile development methodologies. 
b) Tight schedules- Ensure that time allocated is enough and prioritize the tasks to enable production of software that would not compromise the quality.
c) Lack of proper communiction- Ensure that communiction is done properly to front ideas, communicate changes and motivate the staff. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit testing - It is a testing that targets single modulles individuals with the aim of establishing if they are doing what they are supposed to do.
b) Integration testing - testng that is done to establish how different modules are able to work together as they interact.
c) System Testing - It is the testing of the entire/ whole system to check if it is doing what it is supposed to do. 
d) Acceptance testing entails testing the system against the requirements that had been enumerated earlier on. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt Engineering - is the art of creating or crafting right instructions that will enable training of the robot to offer best response

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Tell me something about yourself.
Improved - Tell me your your highest education level. 
the improved prompt would yield better result and specific answer using shortest time.
